Since I'm an organized person, I like to always know what I need to do in the day so I created this To-Do-List to help me with my daily routines. This To-Do-List was a bit different from the other one that was made with only Vanilla JS. This application was made using React, CSS and Javascript.

## Challenges! :pushpin:

The application was developed with React and Javascript. I made a CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) application in order to maintain my daily routines organized. Different from the other application built to be a To-Do-List, this one have some different features.

**New Features! Let's have fun!** ðŸš€

- [x] Change the taskes bettween completed and uncompleted.
